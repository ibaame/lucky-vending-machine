### **Option (1)**
asks the user to enter a name for the "player". The playerâ€™s name must not be blank. If this option is chosen again after a player has already been set up, a "new" player is created (ie. with a new name, no prizes, $0 spent). Note that the "new" player replaces the "old" player - ie. there is only ever one player at any one time.

### **Option (2)**
simulates a lucky guess operation. The computer generates a random number between 1-5. It then asks the player what prize he would like to win by trying to guess that number. The rules are :
